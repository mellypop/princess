This is a ZSH themed, modeled after [abhiyan.zsh](https://github.com/abhiyandhakal/abhiyan.zsh)
with perhaps a bit too much pink and arguably too few emojis.

## Requirements

You will need to have [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) installed.

## Installation

This can be done in a variety of ways. Perhaps the cleanest is to directly source
the theme from your `.zshrc`, but the theme file can also be copied into the
themes directory of oh-my-zsh (`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`) and then loaded by name
by setting `ZSH_THEME="princess"` in your `.zshrc`.
